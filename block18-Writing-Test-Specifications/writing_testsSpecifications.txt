Unit Tests:
1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
  
  Expect the input to be only numbers.
  Expect there to be only 2 inputs.
  Expect a non-number in the input to result in a error.

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. 
It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

  Expect there to only be 2 input arrays.
  Expect there to be only odd and/or even numbers in the array.
  Expect there to be only odd numbers in the output array.
  If a number has already been put into the output array it will not put the same number in.
  If a non-number is in the array it should ignore it and not put it in the output array.
  If it is a even number it should ignore it and not put it in the output array.

Functional Tests:

1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. 
They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

  The checkout button should grayed out unless there is something in the cart.
  If the user is a guest it should prompt the user to sign in and expain the various reasons why they should. (it should be optinal.)
  There should be various input fields to input users data such as Name, city, address, zip code.
